# big-hustler-system-design-design-patterns-hub

I have been super busy, juggling tons of studying and catching up with the industry as I transitioned from the academic world to the industry, all while keeping up with family duties. Over the past decade or so, I've managed to accomplish everything I had wished for as an immigrant from a rural background. This journey began after I dropped out of my PhD to focus on fulfilling my family's dreams and ensuring their retirement.

Now, I'm eager to start giving back to the community that has given me so much. My aim is to inspire other hustlers who are constantly chasing someone else's dreams rather than their own.

I'll be adding resources from my laptop, accumulated over the past few years, and I'll ensure to credit the people who have contributed along the way. You'll witness iterative improvements gradually, as well as well-deserved recognitions and shout-outs to individuals supporting the community and spreading positive messages.

If I've inadvertently missed mentioning someone in my shout-outs, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. I sincerely apologize for any oversight and will rectify it promptly upon receiving the information.
